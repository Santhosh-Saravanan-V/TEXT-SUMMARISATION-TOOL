# Task 1: Text Summarization Tool

## *About the Project*

The *Text Summarization Tool* is a Python-based application that generates concise summaries from lengthy text. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract the most important points, making it easier to understand large volumes of information quickly.

---

## *Key Features*

1. *Automatic Summarization*:
   - Processes lengthy text and condenses it into a short, meaningful summary.
2. *Pre-Trained Model*:
   - Utilizes the Hugging Face T5 model for accurate and high-quality summaries.
3. *Simple Input and Output*:
   - Accepts text input directly or from a file.
   - Displays summaries in the terminal and saves them to a file.

---

## *Resources Used*

- *Python*: Programming language used to develop the tool.
- *Hugging Face Transformers*: Library for the pre-trained T5 model.
- *Additional Libraries*:
  - transformers: For the summarization pipeline.
  - os: For file handling.

---

## *How to Use*

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install the required library:
   bash
   pip install transformers
   

### Instructions
1. Run the script:
   bash
   python text_summarization.py
   
2. Provide the text to summarize when prompted or load it from a file.
3. View the summary in the terminal or open the saved output file (summary_output.txt).

## *Example*

### Input:

 Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver, who is set to compete in Formula One for Ferrari. Hamilton has won a joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles—tied with Michael Schumacher—and holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (202), among others.
Born and raised in Stevenage, Hamilton began his career in karting aged six, winning several national titles and attracting the attention of Ron Dennis, who signed him to the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme in 1998. After winning the direct-drive Karting World Cup and European Championship in 2000, Hamilton progressed to junior formulae, where his successes included winning the Formula 3 Euro Series and the GP2 Series. He subsequently signed for McLaren in 2007, becoming the first black driver to compete in Formula One at the Australian Grand Prix. In his rookie season, Hamilton won four Grands Prix and set several records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. Hamilton won his maiden title in 2008, making a title-deciding overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season to become the then-youngest World Drivers' Champion. The dominant Red Bull-Renault combination prevailed throughout his remaining four seasons at McLaren, with Hamilton achieving multiple race wins in each, including his involvement in a four-way title battle in 2010.



### Output:

 Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton is the first black driver to compete in Formula One at the Australian Grand Prix in 2007 . He has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles, tied with Michael Schumacher . Hamilton holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (

## *Future Improvements*

1. Support for summarizing multiple texts at once.
2. Integration with a graphical user interface for easier use.
3. Extend the tool to work with different languages.

---

## *Conclusion*

The Text Summarization Tool is an efficient solution for generating summaries from lengthy documents. It is straightforward to use, highly accurate, and provides significant time savings for users. The tool is suitable for students, researchers, and professionals handling large volumes of information.
