# Task 1: Text Summarization Tool

## *About the Project*

The *Text Summarization Tool* is a Python-based application that generates concise summaries from lengthy text. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract the most important points, making it easier to understand large volumes of information quickly.

---

## *Key Features*

1. *Automatic Summarization*:
   - Processes lengthy text and condenses it into a short, meaningful summary.
2. *Pre-Trained Model*:
   - Utilizes the Hugging Face T5 model for accurate and high-quality summaries.
3. *Simple Input and Output*:
   - Accepts text input directly or from a file.
   - Displays summaries in the terminal and saves them to a file.

---

## *Resources Used*

- *Python*: Programming language used to develop the tool.
- *Hugging Face Transformers*: Library for the pre-trained T5 model.
- *Additional Libraries*:
  - transformers: For the summarization pipeline.
  - os: For file handling.

## *How to Use*

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install the required library:
   bash
   pip install transformers
   

### Instructions
1. Run the script:
   bash
   python text_summarization.py
   
2. Provide the text to summarize when prompted or load it from a file.
3. View the summary in the terminal or open the saved output file (summary_output.txt).

## *Example*

### Input:

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans.


### Output:

AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to act like humans.

## *Future Improvements*

1. Support for summarizing multiple texts at once.
2. Integration with a graphical user interface for easier use.
3. Extend the tool to work with different languages.
